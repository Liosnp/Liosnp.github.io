## About Me

My initial curiosity began with a simple question: what "shapes" do different types of data take? How do images fold in dimensions, how do trades fluctuate along time, and in what ways do texts disperse in semantic spaces?

I work at the intersection of **alternative data** and **financial risk modeling**. Recently I rebuilt a climate‚ÄìGIS pipeline to align SME locations with gridded satellite climate features and saw **AUC gains of 0.07+** in several countries for default prediction ‚Äî evidence that physical risk signals add value to traditional credit scoring. I care about **usable**, **explainable**, and **accountable** ML that survives real-world frictions.
