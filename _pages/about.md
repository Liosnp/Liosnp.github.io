I work at the intersection of **alternative data** and **financial risk modeling**. Recently I rebuilt a climate–GIS pipeline to align SME locations with gridded satellite climate features and saw **AUC gains of 0.07+** in several countries for default prediction — evidence that physical risk signals add value to traditional credit scoring. I care about **usable**, **explainable**, and **accountable** ML that survives real-world frictions.
